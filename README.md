# 🏥 Medical Equipments Cost Prediction Challenge
This project predicts **transportation costs** for delivering medical equipment to hospitals using machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of the **Kaggle Challenge: [Medical Equipments Cost Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/Medical-Equipments-Cost-Prediction-Challenge)**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to **predict the transport cost** of medical equipment deliveries using data such as equipment size, supplier reliability, shipping method, and order details.  
We applied several regression techniques and compared their performance using **R²**, **MAE**, and **Kaggle leaderboard scores**.

## 🧮 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values with `SimpleImputer`
   - Scaled numerical features with `RobustScaler`
   - Encoded categorical variables using `OneHotEncoder`
   - Engineered date-based cyclic features (sine/cosine encoding)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features such as:
     - Delivery days
     - Cyclic weekday/month encoding
     - Weekend indicators

3. **Model Training**
   - Models used:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Polynomial Regression  
     - Lasso Regression  
     - Ridge Regression  
     - Elastic Net Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - AdaBoost Regressor  
     - XGBoost Regressor  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used `GridSearchCV` for:
     - Ridge, Lasso, AdaBoost, XGBoost, ElasticNet, and RandomForest

# 🅑 Multidimensional Personality Cluster Prediction  
**Assignment 2: Multinomial Classification**

## 🎯 Objective
To predict an individual's **personality cluster (A–E)** based on behavioral and lifestyle attributes.

## 📊 Dataset
- `train.csv`: **1,913 × 14**
- `test.csv`: **479 × 13**
- **Target:** `personality_cluster`

## 🧮 Feature Categories
- **Numerical:** age group, upbringing influence, focus intensity, consistency score  
- **Binary:** identity code, external guidance usage  
- **Categorical:** cultural background (numerically encoded)

## 🔬 Feature Engineering
- Focus squared  
- Log focus  
- Focus–consistency interaction  
- Activity strength  
- Stability mean  
- Guidance ratio  

## ⚙️ Preprocessing
- Scaling: Standard, Min–Max, Robust  
- Encoding: One-Hot & Label Encoding  
- Missing Values: None  

## 📊 EDA Highlights
- Strong positive correlation between **consistency score and Cluster E**
- Heavy class overlap → **non-linear decision boundaries**
- Most features show **low linear separability**

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ✅ **Best**
